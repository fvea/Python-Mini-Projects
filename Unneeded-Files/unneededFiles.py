# unneededFiles.py - program that walks through a folder tree 
# and searches for exceptionally large files or folders—say, ones 
# that have a file size of more than 100MB.

# Logic:
#   1. create function named unneededFiles(path).
#   2. walk through the given path.
#   3. check if current file in list of filenames in the current
#       folder has a size greater than 100MB, if yes, print it.
