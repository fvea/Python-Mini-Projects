# selectiveCopy.py - walks through a folder tree and searches for files with
# a certain file extension(.txt) and copies these files from whatever location
# they are into a new folder.


# LOGIC:
#   1. import shutil for copying folder mechanism.
#   2. import os for path handling.
#   3. create function selectiveCopy()
#   4. walk to the given path folder.
#   5. if the current filename in current folder ends with .txt extension, copy it to destination folder.
